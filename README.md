# unity-helpers
A repo filled with my personal helpers and extension functions for Unity.  Made in C#.

Just download the repo and make sure you delete the gitignore afterwards, as one specific line in it could screw with your own .gitignore (asset metadata is ignored here since this isn't its own Unity project)

Specific information regarding my helpers and prototyping code will eventually be available on my own personal wiki.  Hold tight until then, 'cause right now I have projects to work on and a job to get. :3
