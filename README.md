# unity-helpers
A repo filled with my personal helpers and extension functions for Unity.  Made in C#.

Just download the repo and make sure you delete the gitignore afterwards, as one specific line in it could screw with your own .gitignore (asset metadata is ignored here since this isn't its own Unity project)

I have a wiki started for explaining what these files are and what they do.  It's not fully done, but you can at least get a file listing and I'm working on adding specific pages as I go: http://wiki.dragonfox.digital/doku.php?id=unity:dragonfoxing.unitycsharp
